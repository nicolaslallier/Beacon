# Project Structure

Keep the repository organized into these top-level directories:

- `applications/`: Application source code (e.g., `Library/`).
- `infra/`: Infrastructure and runtime components (compose, Docker, monitoring, ingress, certs).
- `config/`: Tooling and project configuration (env, linters, editor config, Makefile).
- `docs/`: Project documentation.

When moving or adding files, place them under the appropriate directory and update references as needed.
